SolidsPy's tutorials
====================

Here we show through simple examples how to conduct analyses using
SolidsPy.

First we describe the structure of the text files for the
problem of small 2Ã—2 square plate under axial loading. In the second part
of the documents we describe the creation of a
SolidsPy model with the aid of `Gmsh <http://gmsh.info/>`__. This is
necessary when conducting analysis in large and complex geometries. In
this case the Gmsh files need to be converted into text files using
subroutines based upon `meshio <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/meshio>`__.
