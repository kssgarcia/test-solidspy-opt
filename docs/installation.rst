Installation
============

The code is written in Python and it depends on ``numpy``, ``scipy`` and
``sympy``. It has been tested under Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.

To install *SolidsPy* open a terminal and type:

::

    pip install solidspy

To specify through a GUI the folder where the input
files are stored  you will need to install `easygui <http://easygui.readthedocs.org/en/master/>`__.

To easily generate the required SolidsPy text files out of a
`Gmsh <http://gmsh.info/>`__ model you will need
`meshio <https://github.com/nschloe/meshio>`__.

These two can be installed with:

::

    pip install easygui
    pip install meshio
